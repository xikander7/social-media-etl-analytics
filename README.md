<h3>ARCHITECTURE:</h3>

![Architecture]()

Data is sourced from the APIs of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The ETL process is orchestrated using Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS/IDMC) for data extraction, transformation, and loading. AWS S3 serves as the cloud staging area, and the transformed data is loaded into AWS Redshift as the target cloud data warehouse.

<h3>DATA MODEL:</h3>

Dimension Tables:
- `dim_user` (User details from social media)
- `dim_post` (Details of individual posts)
- `dim_date` (Timestamps and date-related information)

Fact Tables:
- `fact_engagement` (Likes, comments, shares, etc.)

The data model follows a star schema design, allowing for efficient querying and analysis. It includes dimension tables representing key entities and a fact table capturing engagement metrics.
